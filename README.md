# Child Mistreatment Effects on Alcohol Consumption: A Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This research project examines the relationship between childhood abuse (physical, sexual, or psychological harm) and subsequent substance abuse issues in adults using Add Health data, focusing on Wave 3 cross-sectional analysis of young adult years.

## 🔍 Key Research Questions
- How does childhood mistreatment impact alcohol consumption in young adults?
- What role do demographic and socioeconomic factors play in this relationship?
- Are there significant gender differences in the impact of mistreatment on substance abuse?

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: Wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health data)
- **Sample Size**: 4,376 respondents
- **Age Range**: 18-28 years

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Data Processing
1. Two-factor analysis approach for childhood maltreatment assessment
2. Variables included:
   - Physical abuse
   - Sexual abuse
   - Physical neglect
   - Social services intervention

### Key Measures
- **Heavy Drinking**: Measured as number of days with 5+ drinks in a row (scale 0-6)
- **Control Variables**:

  - Income
  - Employment status
  - Depression
  - Criminal convictions

## 📈 Key Findings
1. Significant positive association between childhood maltreatment and heavy drinking
2. Gender differences in impact:
   - Males showed marginally higher sensitivity to maltreatment effects
3. Socioeconomic factors:
   - Lower education levels associated with decreased heavy drinking
   - Employment status showed significant correlation with drinking patterns
4. Racial differences observed in both mistreatment rates and alcohol consumption
